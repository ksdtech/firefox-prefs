Firefox deployment scripts

Put these into the Firefox installer tree under

Contents/MacOS/defaults

* aa_kentfield_prefs.js contains default proxy settings and turns off some Firefox features
* browserconfig.properties contains startup page information

To use:

1. Download latest Firefox installer .dmg file from Mozilla website
2. Open .dmg and copy Firefox.app to desktop
3. Copy browserconfig.properties to Contents/MacOS inside Firefox.app
4. Copy aa_kentfield_prefs.js to Contents/MacOS/defaults/pref inside Firefox.app (may need to use Show Package Contents)

Then copy Firefox.app to your Applications folder.

Optional - Create Install Package: 

Use PackageMaker (OS X 10.5 recommended) to create an installer package that can be used with ARD.  

1. Create a "contents" folder inside the "packagemaker" folder
2. Copy the modified Firefox.app to the contents folder
3. sudo chmod -R root:staff Firefox.app
4. Open the pmdoc project file in PackageMaker
5. Build an .mpkg file for use with ARD.

After deploying, don't forget to remove ALL per-user prefs that have been established: 

~/Library/Application Support/Firefox (all files in this folder)
~/Library/Preferences/org.mozilla.firefox.plist
